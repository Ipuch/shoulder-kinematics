Sternoclavicular kinematics cannot be used in spartacus.

This is equivalent to describing the position of a point on the Earth with the use of 2 angles: longitude and latitude. 
Clavicular motion was not monitored directly, but rather, clavicular angles were derived 
from the location of the sternal notch and the acromioclavicular joint, 
which were tracked with the thoracic and scapular receivers, respectively.
